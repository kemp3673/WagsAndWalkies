              Michaela has been walking my puppy Max for about a month now and I
              couldnâ€™t have asked for a better dog walker. I know I can trust
              her to take good care of Max on every walk. She is always on time
              and never fails to send me a text at the end of each walk. I am so
              happy that I decided to use her services.

              Cannot recommend Michaela enough! She took care of our little baby
              girl Enzo last week while we went on vacation! She gave us daily
              updates and pictures! I knew she was being loved just as much as
              if she were at home!

            Michaela is the best! She is so thoughtful, sweet, diligent, and professional. She is so flexible with whatever you need and has the best communication. She takes the time to get to know your dog and always provides the best care. I always know Maggie is in great hands while I am at work. I could not recommend her enough!

            Michaela is the absolute best! We had just gotten our puppy Brownie, a few weeks before my family and I went back home to visit our family. She made us feel so at ease with leaving him. During our time away Michaela sent us photos of Brownie having fun which was really nice. She's a true animal lover and, I would recommend her services to anyone with pets! Thanks Michaela!
